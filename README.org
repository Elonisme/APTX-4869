This is my Emacs configuration, a rework after using Space Emacs, Doom Emacs, Centura Emacs, and my previously self-written Ink Emacs.
I am a new-generation Emacs user, so my experience with it is not very extensive. I first encountered Emacs in my junior year, 
but it wasn't until my senior year that I truly began using it. Now, as a first-year graduate student, I have been using Emacs for almost two years.

When I initially started using Emacs, I aimed to centralize all my tasks within Emacs(All IN) because I found it cool and different from what others were doing. 
I even believed that all the code I wrote had to be part of the free software movement; otherwise, I wouldn't consider myself a 
true advocate of free software. However, this approach came at the cost of consuming a significant amount of time. Despite Emacs introducing me to 
a different world, as a traditional Chinese student, I had to devote considerable time to academic pursuits, especially subjects and tasks that 
required assessment. I needed to publish papers and deal with paper-related tasks. It was time for Emacs to truly demonstrate its value for me.

Hence, I crafted the current configuration. It's not complicated; simplicity is the key. I named this configuration APTX-4869, after a fictional 
drug invented by my favorite anime character, Ai Haibara. This drug transforms the body of an adult into that of a child without affecting 
intelligence and knowledge. I hope this compact and flexible configuration can achieve a similar featâ€”being flexible and practical.

Getting back on track, I hope Emacs can achieve the following functionalities with my configuration:

- Able to realize card notes and serve as a second brain.
- Capable of replacing Typora.
- Capable of lightweight programming in the shell.
- Fast startup speed.
- Moderately aesthetic.

** Supported Emacs versions
Use the latest released Emacs version available to you. 

** Other requirements
If you are using Arch Linux, you can use the ~relying.sh~ to install other requirements.

** Installation
To install, clone this repo to ~.emacs.d~,i.e ensure that the ~init.el~ contained in this repo ends up at
~/.emacs.d/init.el~ :

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git@github.com:Elonisme/APTX-4869.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party packages will be automatically downloaded and 
installed. If you encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly running ~M-x package-refresh-contents~ 
before doing so.

If you correctly initiate the APTX-4869, you will see the following startup screen. I hope you have a great time exploring and enjoying it!
